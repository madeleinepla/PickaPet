### Pet adoption
* Going to the pet store, the user has a choice to choose which pet they want. The pets are randomly filtered and sorted and thus only six pets show up at once. If you own the current pet, they will not show up at the pet store. You can click on the pet and adopt the pet.

### Code
```javascript
  router.get('/search-users/:query', (req, res)=>{
      let userSearch = RegExp(("^.*"+req.params.query+".*$"),'i')
      User.find({username:{$regex:userSearch}})
          .then(user => {
              res.json({ user })
          }).catch(err => res.status(400).json({ error: err.message }))
  })
```

As one of the key features of our website, the search function uses the regex expression to locate the different users available to us. The search input traverses both the backend and frontend and can be case insensitive which assists users in locating other users at a quicker rate.
